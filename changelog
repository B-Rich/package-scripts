bfgminer (2.4.0-1) stable; urgency=low
  Version 2.4.0-1 - May 3, 2012

  - Only show longpoll warning once when it has failed.
  - Convert hashes to an unsigned long long as well.
  - Detect pools that have issues represented by endless rejected shares and
    disable them, with a parameter to optionally disable this feature.
  - Bugfix: Use a 64-bit type for hashes_done (miner_thread) since it can overflow
    32-bit on some FPGAs
  - Implement an older header fix for a label existing before the pthread_cleanup
    macro.
  - Limit the number of curls we recruit on communication failures and with
    delaynet enabled to 5 by maintaining a per-pool curl count, and using a pthread
    conditional that wakes up when one is returned to the ring buffer.
  - Generalise add_pool() functions since they're repeated in add_pool_details.
  - Bugfix: Return failure, rather than quit, if BFwrite fails
  - Disable failing devices such that the user can attempt to re-enable them
  - Bugfix: thread_shutdown shouldn't try to free the device, since it's needed
    afterward
  - API bool's and 1TBS fixes
  - Icarus - minimise code delays and name timer variables
  - api.c V1.9 add 'restart' + redesign 'quit' so thread exits cleanly
  - api.c bug - remove extra ']'s in notify command
  - Increase pool watch interval to 30 seconds.
  - Reap curls that are unused for over a minute. This allows connections to be
    closed, thereby allowing the number of curl handles to always be the minimum
    necessary to not delay networking.
  - Use the ringbuffer of curls from the same pool for submit as well as getwork
    threads. Since the curl handles were already connected to the same pool and are
    immediately available, share submission will not be delayed by getworks.
  - Implement a scaleable networking framework designed to cope with any sized
    network requirements, yet minimise the number of connections being reopened. Do
    this by create a ring buffer linked list of curl handles to be used by getwork,
    recruiting extra handles when none is immediately available.
  - There is no need for the submit and getwork curls to be tied to the pool
    struct.
  - Do not recruit extra connection threads if there have been connection errors
    to the pool in question.
  - We should not retry submitting shares indefinitely or we may end up with a
    huge backlog during network outages, so discard stale shares if we failed to
    submit them and they've become stale in the interim
